# Dotfiles

I need to put more description here

## Installation

### OS X Notes

* You need to be an administrator (for `sudo`).
* You need to have installed [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=xcode) or, at the very minimum, the [XCode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=command%20line%20tools), which are available as a _much smaller_ download thank XCode.

To get started please run:

```bash
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/skwp/dotfiles/master/install.sh`"
```
